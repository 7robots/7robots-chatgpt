      "Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a valuable tool for universities in order to help them achieve their strategic objectives. EA provides a framework to document, analyze, and manage the university's technology and business processes, and provides a common understanding of the university's IT structure. It also enables the university to identify opportunities for improvement, and develop an efficient and effective IT infrastructure. EA can help universities reduce costs, improve services, and increase agility. Additionally, EA can be used to align the university's IT strategy with its overall goals and objectives. Finally, EA can provide the university with a comprehensive view of how its IT assets, processes, and people are integrated and related, enabling them to make informed decisions.\n"

King Minos imprisoned the beast in a labyrinth that he had built, feeding it with human sacrifices from the city of Athens. The hero Theseus decided to slay the Minotaur and ended up relying on the help of the king's daughter, who gave him a ball of yarn to use as a guide and a sword to kill the beast. After killing the Minotaur, Theseus and the princess escaped from the labyrinth and set off to Athens. However, in this retelling, the story takes a different turn when the hero is abandoned by his companions in the maze and ends up wearing the Minotaur's head as a mask, becoming the creature itself and preparing to survive and seek vengeance in the maze.\n"
