      "Good day, class. Today, we will be discussing the major categories of geologic features on the moon. There are five main categories of geologic features on the moon, and each of them provides important clues about the moon's history and evolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we have lunar craters. These are circular depressions on the moon's surface that were formed by the impact of asteroids and comets. The size and shape of craters can provide information on the age and composition of the moon's surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, we have lunar mountains. These are large landforms that rise above the surrounding terrain and are often associated with impact basins. The mountains on the moon are thought to have formed as a result of the thrusting and folding of the moon's crust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, we have lunar maria. These are dark, flat areas on the moon's surface that were formed by ancient volcanic eruptions. The maria are thought to be much younger than the highlands and provide valuable information about the moon's interior and volcanic history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, we have lunar rilles. These are long, narrow depressions on the moon's surface that are thought to be the result of volcanic activity or the collapsing of lava tubes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we have lunar domes. These are small, rounded hills on the moon's surface that were most likely formed by the eruption of low-viscosity lava.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the major categories of geologic features on the moon are craters, mountains, maria, rilles, and domes, each of which provides important information about the moon's history and evolution. Thank you for listening, and I hope you have a better understanding of lunar geology.\n"
